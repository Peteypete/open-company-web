# OpenCompany.io Web Application

## Overview

Build your company in the open with transparency for your co-founders, your team of employees and contractors, and your investors. Or open up your company for everyone, your customers and the rest of the startup community.

[OpenCompany.io](https://opencompany.io) is GitHub for the rest of your company:

* Dashboard - An easy tool for founders to provide transparency to their teams and beyond.
* Founders' Guide - Tools, best practices and insights from open company founders and their companies.
* Open Company Directory - Founders sharing with their teams and beyond.
* Community - Spread the word and knowledge and inspire more founders to open up.

Like the open companies we promote and support, the [OpenCompany.io](https://opencompany.io) platform is completely transparent. The company supporting this effort, Transparency, LLC, is an open company. The platform is open source software, and open company data is [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) accessible through the [platform API](https://github.com/open-company/open-company-api).

To get started, head to [OpenCompany.io](https://opencompany.io).

## Local Setup

Users of the [OpenCompany.io](https://opencompany.io) platform should get started by going to [OpenCompany.io](https://opencompany.io). The following setup is for developers wanting to work on the platform's Web application software.

Most of the dependencies are internal, meaning [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) will handle getting them for you. There are a few exceptions:

* [Java 7/8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) - a Java 7 or 8 JRE is needed to run Clojure
* [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) - Clojure's build and dependency management tool

Chances are your system already has Java 7 or 8 installed. You can verify this with:

```console
java -version
```

If you do not have Java 7 or 8 [download it]((http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)) and follow the installation instructions.

Leiningen is easy to install:

1. Download the latest [lein script from the stable branch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein).
1. Place it somewhere that's on your $PATH (`env | grep PATH`). `/usr/local/bin` is a good choice if it is on your PATH.
1. Set it to be executable. `chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/lein`
1. Run it: `lein` This will finish the installation.

Then let Leiningen install the rest of the dependencies:

```console
lein deps
```

## Usage

To get an interactive development environment run:

```console
lein figwheel
```

Open your browser to [http://localhost:3449/](http://localhost:3449/).

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to test it is:

```clojure
(js/alert "Am I connected?")
```

You should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

```console
lein clean
```

To create a production build run:

```console
lein cljsbuild once min
```

Open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading nor a REPL.
